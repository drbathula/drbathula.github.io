I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Ropar. I graduated from the University of Auckland, New Zealand in 2002 with a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Systems. After a brief stint as a Software Engineer in the healthcare industry, I joined the graduate program at Yale University and earned my PhD in Biomedical Engineering in May 2009. My doctoral dissertation involved statistical modeling of brain activation patterns for robust analysis of Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. Prior to joining IIT Ropar, I worked as a Research Associate at Oregon Health & Science University.

My research interests focus on applying computational and statistical methods to address challenges in medical imaging. Particularly, development of image/signal processing, pattern recognition and machine learning techniques to assist in biomedical image analysis and diagnostic decision making.
