* Specifically, development of advanced image/signal processing and analysis methodologies and application of pattern recognition and machine learning techniques to assist in biomedical image analyses for improved patient outcomes.
* One overarching focus of our research is identification of brain imaging based biomarkers for psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimerâ€™s, Depression, etc.
* Our research has potential applications in noninvasive diagnosis, early screening, personalized treatment and monitoring for a number of diseases, as well as for understanding underlying mechanisms of disease.
* Research activities at the lab deal with a wide range of state-of-the-art medical imaging modalities including: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI), Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Computer Tomography (CT), Electroencephalography (EEG), etc.
